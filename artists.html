<div class="artists">
    <p id="art-1">Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur and fashion designer. West is among the most critically acclaimed musicians of the 21st
         century, with his music having spanned a broad range of styles, incorporating an eclectic range of influences including hip hop, soul, baroque pop, electro, indie rock, synth-pop, industrial, and gospel. 
         Outside of his music career, West's success in the fashion industry has led to him being recognized as one of the most influential popular culture figures of his generation. </p>
    <p id="art-2">Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is regarded by many critics and contemporaries as one of the most important and influential
         rappers of his generation, and as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Raised in Compton, California, Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager under the stage name K-Dot, releasing a 
         mixtape that garnered local attention and led to his signing with indie record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). He began to gain recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. </p>
    <p id="art-3">Denzel Rae Don Curry (born February 16, 1995) is an American rapper, singer, and composer. Raised in Carol City, Florida, Curry started rapping while in sixth grade and began working on his first mixtape in 2011, when he was attending school. Influenced by underground Florida rapper SpaceGhostPurrp, the mixtape was later featured on Purrp's social media, giving Curry local attention and resulting in Curry joining Purrp's hip-hop collective, Raider Klan.
        Curry left Raider Klan in 2013, releasing his debut studio album, Nostalgic 64, in September of that year, while still in high school. </p>
